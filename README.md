# About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on analysing the [world happiness index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2022) from the world report index.
# Problem Definition and Explanation
The quest for happiness has evolved into a crucial component of both personal and social well-being in today's environment of fast change. We may learn a lot about the aspects that lead to a fulfilled and content populace by examining the factors that influence happiness in a nation. We can pinpoint important factors influencing happiness and spot trends and patterns that might have a big influence on total life satisfaction by analyzing a large dataset that includes numerous social, economic, and political variables. Understanding these characteristics enables us, organizations, and people to create and implement focused initiatives that can improve citizens' well-being, advance a more peaceful society, and ultimately develop a happier country.

# Objective
Our objective is to utilize machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest and Hierarchical Clustering, to investigate factors affecting happiness in a country. Random Forest offers robustness and accuracy in modeling complex relationships, while Hierarchical Clustering reveals regional patterns by grouping countries based on similarity. Together, these methods provide valuable insights to drive targeted strategies for enhancing well-being across diverse nations and cultures.

# What we have provided 
1. Data set for World Happiness
2. Presentation Slides
3. Our main project Notebook
   --> Data Cleaning and Preperation
   
   --> EDA ( Exploratory Data Analysis)
   
   --> Machine Learning Models ( Explained Below)

# Models Used
For this project we used two different Machine Learning (ML) to help us with our project, these two are:
  1. Random Forest 
  2. Hierarchical Clustering

# Conclusion
1. We have concluded that most factors (GDP, Social Support, etx...) are important and cannont be removed, besides Whisker High and Low, Rank and Country as they cannot be used as predictor variables.
2. The Bar chart for Random Forest shows conclusion of Tree created. suggesting that GDP per capita has the highest importance in influencing happiness in a country.
3. The more developed the country, (better social support, stronger economies) would tend to have a higher happiness score compared to underdeveloped countries.
