# About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on analysing the [world happiness index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2022) from the world report index.
# Problem Definition and Explanation
In today's rapidly evolving world, the pursuit of happiness has become a central aspect of individual and societal well-being. By investigating the factors affecting happiness in a country, we can gain valuable insights into the elements that contribute to a fulfilled and content population. Employing advanced machine learning methods, such as Random Forest and Hierarchical clustering, allows us to uncover complex relationships and identify key determinants of happiness with greater accuracy and efficiency. These techniques were chosen for their ability to handle large datasets, manage multiple variables, and minimize biases that may arise from traditional statistical approaches. Analyzing a comprehensive dataset that captures various social, economic, and political dimensions, along with the implementation of these robust machine learning methods, empowers policymakers, institutions, and individuals to design and implement targeted interventions that can enhance the well-being of citizens, promote a more harmonious society, and ultimately, foster a happier nation.
# Models Used
For this project we used two different Machine Learning (ML) to help us with our project, these two are:
  1. Random Forest 
  2. Hierarchical Clustering


# Conclusion
1. We have concluded that most factors (GDP, Social Support, etx...) are important and cannont be removed, besides Whisker High and Low, Rank and Country as they cannot be used as predictor variables.
2. The Bar chart for Random Forest shows conclusion of Tree created. suggesting that GDP per capita has the highest importance in influencing happiness in a country.
3. The more developed the country, (better social support, stronger economies) would tend to have a higher happiness score compared to underdeveloped countries.
