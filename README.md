# About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on analysing the [world happiness index](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2022) from the world report index.
# Problem Definition and Explanation
We decided on investigating the world happiness index as we realised that as the world changes, people nowadays especially in asian societies are getting more and more stressed in life which would affect their content towards living. Hence we wanted to investigate what are the possible factors that would have a correlation in swaying the general happiness in a given population.
# Models Used
For this project we used two different Machine Learning (ML) to help us with our project, these two are:
  1. Random Forest 
  2. Hierarchical Clustering


# Conclusion
1. We have concluded that most factors (GDP, Social Support, etx...) are important and cannont be removed, besides Whisker High and Low, Rank and Country as they cannot be used as predictor variables.
2. The Bar chart for Random Forest shows conclusion of Tree created. suggesting that GDP per capita has the highest importance in influencing happiness in a country.
3. The more developed the country, (better social support, stronger economies) would tend to have a higher happiness score compared to underdeveloped countries.
